<h2>
  Your task: Fix or implement all the endpoints linked below.
</h2>
<p>
  Code sources of this super simple application is full of BAD CODE or BAD PRACTICES.
  Your goal is to fix it.
</p>
<p>
  You will find instructions and tips in codebase's comments (or the endpoints' specs).
  Use your own judgement of what is important to be fixed and how should they be implemented.
  <br/>
  Have a look at ProductsController and its spec (products_controller_spec.rb).
  Make sure all endpoints there are working properly.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <a href="/products/seed?category=Guitars">GET products/seed guitars </a>
    (or <a href="/products/seed?category=grocery">GET products/seed groceries </a>)
  </li>
  <li><a href="/products.json">GET all products (as JSON)</a></li>
  <li><a href="/products.html">GET all products (as HTML)</a> (we want simple page with HTML
    products table here)
  </li>
  <li><a href="/products/1">GET products/ID</a> - please hide secret_code attribute and timestamps
    (see source code and specs for details) !
  </li>
  <li><a href="/products/destroy">DELETE products/destroy all products</a> (TODO fix link)</li>
  <li>
    <form action="/products" method="post">
      Name:<input type="text" name="product[name]" value="iPad mini">
      Price:<input type="text" name="product[price]" value="100.00">
      Category:<input type="text" name="product[category]" value="electronics">
      <input type="submit" value="create product">
    </form>
    <a href="/products/create"></a></li>
  </li>
  <li><a href="/products/uniq_categories">GET products/uniq_categories JSON</a> just names of ALL
    product's categories as JSON array)
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="/products/expensive_categories">GET products/expensive_categories</a> similar as above,
    but limited to expensive products (see details in action's source code coments)
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="/products/cached/1">GET products/cached/ID</a> let this url do the same as show action, but make it cached.
    Ensure cache is invalidated when product is updated.
    Decide yourself which application level to cache at.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>
  While working on the endpoints above:
</h2>
<ul>

  <li>Improve the source code!
    <ul>
      <li>
        The code of this application is <strong>full of BAD practices</strong> and poor quality
        code.
        Improve the code where you think it is necessary.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    Improve DB design
    <ul>
      <li>
        For simplification of the example database is a default RoR's sqlite3.
        Do not worry about the choice. Assume it is fine for our excercise. Do not change it.

      </li>
      <li>
        DB structure is just 1 flat table. Feel free to change DB structure etc where you think it makes
        sense for the needs of the excercise.
      </li>
    </ul>

  </li>
  <li>
    FIX tests + implement missing ones.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Make sure all tests are passing and are useful.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can find all the tests in "specs" folder (feel free to use any other test library if this is
        your preference).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2> IGNORE THE FRONT-END code here !</h2>
This is an excercise related to your backend skills. Do not worry about front-end related code at all.
